HOW TO USE THE MYSQLPHPGRID CLASS, VERSION 0.6.4:
=================================================

1. Use on a full table:
<?
include("mysqlphpgrid.class.php");
$grid = new mysqlphpgrid("<HOSTNAME>", "<USERNAME>", "<PASSWORD>", "<DATABASENAME>", "<TABLENAME>");
$grid->add_allowed      = false;    // optional: only if you don't want the user to add records
$grid->delete_allowed   = false;    // optional: only if you don't want the user to delete records
$grid->update_allowed   = false;    // optional: only if you don't want the user to update cells
$grid->pagelength       = <length>; // optional: only if you want another langth than 20 (default)
$grid->show_id_field    = false;    // optional: only if you don't want to show the id field
$grid->UpdateData();                // to update data in database as specified by parameters
echo $grid->ShowTable();            // to generate the html. This is the only function that generates html!!
?>

2. Use to display parts of a table:
<?
include("mysqlphpgrid.class.php");
class Mytablegrid extends mysqlphpgrid {
    protected function select(){
        $res = mysql_query("<PUT YOUR OWN QUERY HERE USING $this->table AS TABLENAME>" . $this->orderbystr, $this->conn) or die(mysql_error());
        return ($res);
    }
    function add(){
        mysql_query("<PUT YOUR INSERT QUERY HERE USING $this->table AS TABLENAME>)", $this->conn) or die(mysql_error());
        if (mysql_affected_rows($this->conn) == 1) return(true); else return(false);
    }
}
$grid = new mysqlphpgrid("<HOSTNAME>", "<USERNAME>", "<PASSWORD>", "<DATABASENAME>", "<TABLENAME>");
<PUT HERE YOUR CHANGES OF THE DEFAULT SETTINGS, AS SPECIFIED ABOVE>
$grid->UpdateData();                // to update data in database as specified by parameters
echo $grid->ShowTable();            // to generate the html. This is the only function that generates html!!
